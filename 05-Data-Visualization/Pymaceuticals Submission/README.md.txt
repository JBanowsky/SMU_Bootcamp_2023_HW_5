05-Data-Visualization/Submission

This activity is the SMU Boot Camp Module 5 Challenge. 
In this module assignment, I performed data visualization using Matplotlib and Statistical Functions in Jupyter Notebook to analyze a study from 2 csv files: 
Mouse_metadata.csv and Study_results.csv

Most of the code was resourced by the SMU Bootcamp material.

Activity Summary:
By merging to csv files from a mice study, the code will display visual and statistical analysis of the cancer drug trials.

Code Summary:
The majority of this code was taught or taken directly from class resources. 

After merging the code, the code was cleaned by removing a dupicate mouse. 
The code uses condtional in a for loop to identify the duplicate mouse and then to remove it.

The summary statisitcs table is created with groupby's and a dataframe and also an aggregation method shown in class.

The charts, quartiles and correlations are created using code taught directly in the course.
This code used pandas, matplotlib, and spicy.stats. 

The analysis of the data can be found at the top of the code file.
